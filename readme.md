Who do I work for? [Esri Canada](https://esri.ca)

Am I a programmer? Not professionally any more. But I code.

What do I like to code?
- Stuff that makes my life better
- Stuff that is fun
- Scripting repetitive things

I would like to collaborate on projects, but I haven't yet. Someday I'll find the right project, I'm sure.
